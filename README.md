**American Sign Language Detection Project**
Welcome to the American Sign Language (ASL) Detection project! 
This repository contains the code and resources for detecting and interpreting American Sign Language gestures using machine learning techniques.

**Project Overview**
The aim of this project is to develop a system that can recognize and interpret ASL gestures in real time. 
American Sign Language is a visual language used by the deaf and hard-of-hearing community for communication. 
We can bridge the communication gap between hearing and non-hearing individuals by leveraging computer vision and machine learning algorithms.

**Dataset**
We have trained our ASL detection model using a large dataset of ASL gesture images. The dataset contains images of different hand gestures that correspond.

**Model Architecture**
Our ASL detection model uses deep learning techniques, specifically convolutional neural networks (CNNs). 
The architecture consists of several convolutional layers followed by fully connected layers. 
This design allows the model to learn meaningful representations from input images and make accurate predictions.
